# Redis Sentinel Client for Node.js


Supplements [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) with [Redis Sentinel](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel) support.

From the Sentinel docs:

> Redis Sentinel is a system designed to help managing Redis instances. It performs the following three tasks:  
> **Monitoring.** Sentinel constantly check if your master and slave instances are working as expected.  
> **Notification.** Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or another computer program, via an API, 
> that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.  
> **Automatic failover.** If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process 
> where a slave is promoted to master, the other additional slaves are reconfigured to use the new master, 
> and the applications using the Redis server informed about the new address to use when connecting.


## Goals

1. Transparent, drop-in replacement for RedisClient, handling connections to master, slave(s), and sentinel in the background.
2. Handles all RedisClient operations (including pub/sub).
3. No loss of data during failover.

This was originally part of a [fork of node_redis](https://github.com/DocuSignDev/node_redis),
and has been subsequently split to its own module.
(However, it still currently requires changes to node_redis to work, so it still depends on the fork.)

See related thread about different approaches to Sentinel support: https://github.com/mranney/node_redis/issues/302


## Concepts

- connects to a single sentinel, which is watching a single master/slave(s) cluster
- maintains an activeMasterClient in the background, automatically updates on failover (using psub)
- behaves exactly like a single RedisClient
- passes thru all client commands, behaves transparently like a `RedisClient`

## Usage

`npm install redis-sentinel-client`

```
var RedisSentinel = require('redis-sentinel-client');
var sentinelClient = RedisSentinel.createClient(options);
// or
var sentinelClient = RedisSentinel.createClient(PORT, HOST);
```

Now use `sentinelClient` as a regular client: `set`, `get`, `hmset`, etc.

## Instantiation options

- `masterName`: Which master the sentinel is listening to. Defaults to 'mymaster'. (If a sentinel is listening to multiple masters, create multiple `SentinelClients`.)
- `masterOptions`: The options object which will be passed on to the Redis master client connection. See the [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis#rediscreateclientport-host-options) documentation for more details.
- `master_auth_pass`: If your master and slave(s) need authentication (`options.auth_pass` in node_redis, as of 0.8.5), this is passed on. (Note, the sentinel itself does not take authentication.)
- `logger`: pass in [winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) or another custom logger, otherwises uses console. (Expects a `log` method.)
- `debug`: verbose output (to `logger` about internal ops)


## Methods

- `getMaster()`: returns a reference to the sentinel client's `activeMasterClient` (also available directly)
- `reconnect()`: used on instantiation and on psub events, this checks if the master has changed and connects to the new master.
- `send_command()` (and any other `RedisClient` command): command is passed to the master client.


## Events

- `sentinel message` (`msg`): passed up from the sentinel's channel listener. Note, messages can be about other masters, does not differentiate.
- `failover-start`: corresponds to sentinel's `+failover-triggered` message.
- `failover-end`: corresponds to sentinel's `+failover-end` message.
- `disconnected`: old master disconnected.
- `reconnected` (`newMasterClient`): new master reconnected. (In theory should be instant swapover, so no lag.) Passes new client ref for convenience.
    - (Use new ref for pub/sub and other long-running operations, otherwise let client pass through commands.)
- `error` (`error`): An error occured. (Currently does not differentiate errors in different components.) Will fire errors during a failover, before new master is connected.


## Tests

There are currently 2 tests, run with [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha):

1. I/O test: Basic usage, compatibility with RedisClient in functional state.  
  - Run with `npm test`.
2. Failover test: With a master on 5379, slave on 5380, and sentinel on 8379,
this verifies that the SentinelClient connects to the new master,
and buffers all IO, including pub/sub, not losing any data integrity during the failover.  
  - Run with `./node_modules/.bin/mocha --ui tdd --reporter spec --bail test/test-failover`  
(The failover test is isolated from the other, so it doesn't break the normal IO tests.)


## Limitations

- Unlike `RedisClient`, `SentinelClient` is not / does not need to be a stream
- Sentinel docs don't specify a default host+port, so option-less implementations of `createClient()` won't be compatible.
- Have not put any time into `multi` support, unknown status.


## Possible roadmap

- Multiple master/slave(s) clusters per sentinel
  - But thinking not: Just create multiple sentinel clients, one per cluster.
